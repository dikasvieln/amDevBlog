Hi folks, This week will be new info about the blog's site. It changes entire blogs with next js + typescript engine. Some other posts will be migrated in a couple of days. And will be published in the next month.

##Why using NEXT JS

Itâ€™s because next js is SSR(Server Side Rendering) site which means the site can be able to convert HTML files on the server into a fully rendered HTML page for the client.   
Some server side rendering advantages include:
- Improve user experience when they are first-timers to accessing the blog.
- The search engine can easily index and crawl content because the content can be rendered before the page is loaded
- Webpages are correctly indexed. 
- Render server-side helps efficiently load the webpage for the user with slow connection internet.


##Conclusion

Hope you find the new blog will be fast and more exciting to come. Thank you for reading my last article on this site engine. Stay healthy and God bless you always.
